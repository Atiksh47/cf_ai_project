## How It Works

### AI-Powered Creativity

This Writing Assistant uses **Llama 3** (via Cloudflare Workers AI) to provide intelligent, contextual help with your writing projects. The AI:

- **Remembers your projects** and writing style preferences
- **Adapts suggestions** based on your genre and themes
- **Provides personalized feedback** and creative guidance
- **Learns from your interactions** to offer better assistance

### Smart Tool System

Each writing tool combines **structured templates** with **AI enhancement**:

1. **Tool Template** - Provides consistent formatting and structure
2. **AI Processing** - Llama 3 adds creativity, personalization, and context
3. **Dynamic Output** - Results are tailored to your specific needs and conversation history

### Memory & State Management

The assistant uses **Cloudflare Durable Objects** to:

- **Persist conversation history** across sessions
- **Remember your writing projects** and characters
- **Track your progress** and preferences
- **Maintain context** for better assistance
